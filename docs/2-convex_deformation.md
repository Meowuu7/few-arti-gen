# Convex Deformation


The convex deformation stage learns the deformation module via convex pairs in correspondence. 


## Usage
Change configs in `scripts/convex_deformation/train_def_cages.sh` by specifying data-related configurations. And run the script
```bash
bash scripts/convex_deformation/train_def_cages.sh
```

**TODOs**
- [ ] Configs for each convex categroy
- [ ] Pre-trained weights
